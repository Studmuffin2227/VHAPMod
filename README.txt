[Insert FAQ]

FAQ: 
Q: Do I need to host a MC server for this to work?
A: No, the mod runs through the internal server that is created with singleplayer worlds.

Q: Is this compatible with multiplayer servers/other methods of playing with others?
A: Methods like Essentials, E4MC, or hosting a server may or may not work, I'm not able to test, as I have no friends that like VaultHunters.

Q: I completed a check, but forgot to connect to the APworld, is the check lost?
A: As the code currently is, yes. The check tries to send, but is lost as it has nowhere to go. (Offline check completion will be developed before release)

Any further questions can be asked inside the archipelago discord server, inside the future-game-development post for Vaulthunters.
